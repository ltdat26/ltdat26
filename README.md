## 🕰️ Short History 🕰️

Once upon a time I was an admin for the company's Linux network. During this time I was responsible for the operation of the building's network (local military base), before also becoming a technician.

After few years working as technician I left and stay at home. In 2018 I got my first Mac, and started to learn Python to keep my hand in.

Then the Data things came along, and I started to learn Data Analysis. Along the way I worked as technical and reviewer on a number of games.

Throughout this time I self hosted my website & email server amongst other things. I've also provided Linux support for others.

## 📚 Currently working on ... 📚

In 2020/2021 I started to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming. At the moment I am mostly focused on completing [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/ltdat26) challenges.

I've also begun learning React & NodeJS.

<details><summary><h2>🤪 Why **Ltdat26**? 🤪</h2></summary>
<p>
It is a acronym for my full name. It's sound like "Ltd" which a shortened form for "Limited liability" very frequently see behind the name of a company. And 26 is my date of birth.
